            <h3>Why Michael Jackson is the best?</h3>
            <p>
              Michael Jackson was incredibly talented musically. His music was a
              mix of genres, including pop, R&B, soul and funk. He also used
              many innovative techniques in his music, such as beatboxing,
              sampling, and synthesizers. Furthermore, the King of Pop was known
              for his stunning dance performances during his performances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through his dance, fashion and redefinition of music videos,
              Jackson proliferated visual performance for musical artists.
              Credited for influencing hundreds of musicians, his songs are
              among the most covered and sampled in music history.

                  "Smooth Crimnal" is from his seventh studio album, Bad (1987).
                  It was written by Jackson and produced by Jackson and Quincy
                  Jones. The lyrics describe a woman who has been attacked in
                  her apartment by a "smooth criminal".

                <h4>Bad</h4>
                <p>
                  "Bad" is a song about the street. It's about this kid from a
                  bad neighborhood who gets to go away to a private school. He
                  comes back to the old neighborhood when he's on a break from
                  school and the kids from the neighborhood start giving him
                  trouble. He sings, "I'm bad, you're bad, who's bad, who's the
                  best?"

                  The song combined Michael's message of racial harmony with a
                  measure of defiance, as the lyrics noted “we're one and the
                  same,” while expressing exasperation with continued racial
                  injustice and his lack of fear of anyone not willing to accept
                  his message, a statement that still resonates.
