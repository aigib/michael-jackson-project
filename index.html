            <h3>Why Michael Jackson is the best?</h3>
            <p>
              Michael Jackson was incredibly talented musically. His music was a
              mix of genres, including pop, R&B, soul and funk. He also used
              many innovative techniques in his music, such as beatboxing,
              sampling, and synthesizers. Furthermore, the King of Pop was known
              for his stunning dance performances during his performances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through his dance, fashion and redefinition of music videos,
              Jackson proliferated visual performance for musical artists.
              Credited for influencing hundreds of musicians, his songs are
              among the most covered and sampled in music history.
